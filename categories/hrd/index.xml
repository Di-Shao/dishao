      <description>Background Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) is a predictive biomarker for ovarian cancer treated with PARP inhibitors or for breast cancer treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. However, limited research is documented on platinum-based treatment prediction with HRD as a biomarker in ovarian cancer patients, especially in the Chinese population.
Methods
We investigated the association between HRD status and the response of platinum-based chemotherapy in 240 Chinese HGSOC patients.
Results The Pt-sensitive patients showed higher HRD scores than Pt-resistant ones, but this was not significant(median: 42.</description>
